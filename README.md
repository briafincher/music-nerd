Users are able to visualize genre relationships through a dynamic force-directed graph and generate custom visualizations based on quantitative measures of audio features such as energy, danceability and valence. 

After uncovering the connections between 1500+ genres, users can go to a specific genre's page (or choose to visit a random one) to learn more about that genre.

While exploring, users can see:

a genre's description:

an in-depth look at its audio features:

and top related genres. 

Upon connecting the app to their Spotify account, users can also save a genre-specific playlist--perfect background music for further musical exploration.
